Space Fun Facts
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
On October 4, 1957, the first man-made satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched into orbit by the USSR. Sputnik 1 was about the size of a beach ball and took about 98 minutes to orbit the Earth.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
In 2009 two communications satellites, from the US and Russia, collided. This is the only time two man-made satellites have collided by accident.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Pluto is smaller than the United States. If you were to walk around the equator of Pluto it would be the same distance as walking from London to Denver (well, give or take 56 miles).
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
A light year is the distance that light can travel in one year. It works out at about 10 million kilometres (6 million million miles)!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
In 1962, a programmer omitted a single hyphen in the code for the Mariner I rocket, causing it to explode shortly after take off. This typo cost NASA the equivalent of $630 million dollars today. 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Neptune has a radius of 15.387 miles or 24.764 kilometers, about four times wider than Earth, and a diameter of 49.244 km or 30.598 mi being the fourth largest planet of the solar system.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The outer shell of Mercury is only 500 to 600 kilometers (310 to 375 miles) thick.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Mercury has wrinkles.
Yes - As the iron core of the planet cooled and contracted, the surface of the planet became wrinkled. Scientist have named these wrinkles, Lobate Scarps. These Scarps can be up to a mile high and hundreds of miles long.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Venus rotates in the opposite direction to other planets.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
_On Mars, sunsets are blue._
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Venus is hotter than Mercury because it has a much thicker atmosphere. The atmosphere, the gaseous layer surrounding a planet, is like a blanket, which traps heat inside the planet.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Saturn gives off more energy than it receives from the Sun. 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
“Once in a blue moon” = Once every 2-3 years.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Neil Armstrong had to fill an immigration form while coming back to the earth from the moon.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Stars don't appear to be moving, but they are actually traveling roughly 1,000 times faster than the fastest spacecraft that's ever flown.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Each time you see a full moon you always see the same side.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The guy who discovered Pluto’s moon Charon made up the name to resemble his wife’s name, Charlene. He later discovered that in Greek mythology, Charon was the ferryman who brought the souls of the dead across the river Styx to Hades, AKA Pluto.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the solar system.
Only the Sun, Moon and Venus are brighter. It is one of five planets visible to the naked eye from Earth.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Comets are leftovers from the creation of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago – they consist of sand, ice and carbon dioxide.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Gravity might be carried by massless particles called gravitons.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The February of 1865 is the only month in recorded history not to have a full moon.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
To an observer standing on Pluto, the sun would appear no brighter than Venus appears in our evening sky.      
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Earth's core is about 4,400 miles (7,100 km) wide, slightly larger than half the Earth's diameter and about the same size as Mars' diameter.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
There are three main types of galaxies out in space, and they are spiral, elliptical, and irregular.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Enceladus, one of Saturn’s smaller moons, reflects some 90% of the sunlight, making it more reflective than snow!      
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
If the Sun were scaled down to the size of a white blood cell, the Milky Way galaxy would be twice the length of the United States.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Lightning that strikes earth is hotter than the surface of the sun.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Pluto is smaller than Russia.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Stars don't appear to be moving, but they are actually traveling roughly 1,000 times faster than the fastest spacecraft that's ever flown.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The Sun is actually white. & Not yellow.

If you keep going North, you will eventually go South, but if you keep going East, you will never go West.

On a clear night, the human eye can see between 2,000 and 3,000 stars in the sky.
───────────────────────────────────────
The Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System.
This varies according to the part of the planet; for example, the metallic core is denser than the crust. The average density of the Earth is approximately 5.52 grams per cubic centimetre.

To live in space for a year, you would have to consume 730 L of your own recycled sweat and urine.
───────────────────────────────────────
When Helium is cooled to absolute zero, it becomes a liquid that flows against gravity.
───────────────────────────────────────
There's no "zero gravity" in space. Astronauts are in a constant state of free fall, which is why they appear to float.
───────────────────────────────────────
A bolt of lighting contains enough energy to cook 100,000 slices of toast.
───────────────────────────────────────
Faking the moon landing in 1969 would have been harder than actually going to the moon.

It would also take the efforts of more than 400,000 conspirators to keep it a secret.
───────────────────────────────────────
The atmosphere in Titan, Saturn's Moon, is so thick and the gravity so low, that humans can fly through it by flapping "wings" attached to their arms.
───────────────────────────────────────
If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space, they will bond and be permanently stuck together, it's called cold welding.

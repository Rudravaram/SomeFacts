One day David decided to photograph himself with his head in his freezer and 
post the photo on Flickr with the name of 241543903, a randomly generated number from the combination of David's refrigerator barcode and Udon and Edamame noodles.
But david did not stop there, he asked his friends to do the same. 

The social experiment, therefore, began to spread like wildfire, to the extent that millions of people around the world followed David's instructions, sticking their heads in the freezer and taking a vow, with hundreds of thousands of different variables. The number 241543903 involves children and adults thus triggering everyone's imagination and giving unimaginable results that can only tear a smile most of the time.
We know how to like and dislike art and it is subject to the personal taste of each one of us, but in this case, we can certainly not deny that David has certainly contagious artistic findings.

Ketchup is a table condiment or sauce. Although original recipes used egg whites, mushrooms, oysters, grapes, mussels, or walnuts, among other ingredients,[1][2] the unmodified term now typically refers to tomato ketchup.[3]

Tomato ketchup is a sweet and tangy condiment made from tomatoes, sugar, and vinegar, with seasonings and spices. The spices and flavors vary, but commonly include onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic, and mustard, and sometimes include celery, cinnamon, or ginger.[4]

In the United Kingdom, preparations of ketchup were historically and originally prepared with mushrooms as a primary ingredient, rather than tomatoes.[12][13][14] Ketchup recipes began to appear in British and then American cookbooks in the 18th century. In a 1742 London cookbook, the fish sauce had already taken on a very British flavor, with the addition of shallots and mushrooms. The mushrooms soon became the main ingredient and from 1750 to 1850 the word "ketchup" began to mean any number of thin dark sauces made of mushrooms or even walnuts.[15] In the United States, mushroom ketchup dates back to at least 1770, and was prepared by British colonists in the Thirteen Colonies.[16] In contemporary times, mushroom ketchup is available in the UK, although it is not a commonly used condiment.[17]
